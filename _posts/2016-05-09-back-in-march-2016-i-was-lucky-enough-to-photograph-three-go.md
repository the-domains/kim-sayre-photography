description: "Back in March 2016 I was lucky enough to photograph three gorgeous bridal models for my favorite Grass Valley hair and make up salon, Blush (formerly Danae Marie's Salon.) The amazing team of stylists and I put together several different looks on our three models, and The Stonehouse provided the perfect backdrop! So excited for the new owner and staff, and I hear it may be ready to host events by late summer! It's an amazing building with tons of history and lore attached to it. My lovely assistant for the day Samantha had her ghost finder app on in the morning as we walked through to decide which areas to shoot! If I could only shoot at one venue for the rest of my wedding career, this would be it! Anyway, here are a few images from the day... many more to come! Thanks to April Cose, Lisa Harter and Heather Sanderson for sharing the creative vision and all your hard work in the freezing cold; to Arame Laine, Amanda Snelgrove and Amanda Straub for stretching to the limits, literally, and the Stonehouse Event Planner and Sales Manager, Christi Nasser for arranging for us to shoot in this amazing location!! For more Stonehouse event questions and details, you can call Christi at 530-264-8750."
